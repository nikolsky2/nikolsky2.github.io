        permission and Approximate location permission (non-continuous). Complete details on each type of Personal Data collected are provided in the dedicated sections of this privacy policy or by specific explanation texts displayed prior to the Data
        collection. Personal Data may be freely provided by the User, or, in case of Usage Data, collected automatically when using this Application. Unless specified otherwise, all Data requested by this Application is mandatory and failure to provide
        this Data may make it impossible for this Application to provide its services. In cases where this Application specifically states that some Data is not mandatory, Users are free not to communicate this Data without consequences to the availability
        or the functioning of the Service. Users who are uncertain about which Personal Data is mandatory are welcome to contact the Owner. Any use of Cookies – or of other tracking tools – by this Application or by the owners of third-party services
        used by this Application serves the purpose of providing the Service required by the User, in addition to any other purposes described in the present document and in the Cookie Policy, if available. Users are responsible for any third-party Personal
        Data obtained, published or shared through this Application and confirm that they have the third party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.

      <h2>Device permissions for Personal Data access</h2>
      <p>Depending on the User's specific device, this Application may request certain permissions that allow it to access the User's device Data as described below. By default, these permissions must be granted by the User before the respective information
        can be accessed. Once the permission has been given, it can be revoked by the User at any time. In order to revoke these permissions, Users may refer to the device settings or contact the Owner for support at the contact details provided in the
        present document. The exact procedure for controlling app permissions may be dependent on the User's device and software. Please note that the revoking of such permissions might impact the proper functioning of this Application. If User grants
        any of the permissions listed below, the respective Personal Data may be processed (i.e accessed to, modified or removed) by this Application.
      </p>

      <h5>Approximate location permission (non-continuous)</h5>
      <p>Used for accessing the User's approximate device location. This Application may collect, use, and share User location Data in order to provide location-based services. The geographic location of the User is determined in a manner that isn't continuous.
        This means that it is impossible for this Application to derive the approximate position of the User on a continuous basis.
      </p>
      <h5>Camera permission</h5>
      <p>Used for accessing the camera or capturing images from the device.
